# Cell object plugin template

Copy this directory when starting a cell-object plugin. The template has the two required runtime halves:

- `cell.project`: synchronous, inexpensive logic that returns the compact value shown inside a grid cell.
- `renderer.load`: a lazy import of the expanded React UI shown when the object is opened.

It also defines creation, validation, migration, and portable serialization boundaries. Keep plugin-owned state on the object record; the Counter example uses `count`.

Plugin renderers own their CSS. Import package styles from the plugin entry or renderer; do not add plugin selectors to `src/ui/styles/styles.css`. Only use documented host primitives for shell structure.

A plugin that needs configuration may add one optional lazy Settings contribution:

```js
settings: {
	id: "general",
	label: "Counter",
	icon: IconSettings,
	order: 100,
	loadingLabel: "Loading counter settings",
	load: async () => (await import("./CounterSettings.jsx")).CounterSettings,
},
```

The tab exists only while the plugin is enabled. Its component and CSS stay in the package, and approved host/profile services come through `tactile:host`. `loadingLabel` is optional copy for the host-owned themed Suspense state.

## Install at runtime

The marketplace loader obtains a descriptor exported by the downloaded package and passes it to the session provider:

```js
const uninstall = plugins.install(downloadedModule.default);
```

Registration is observable. The enabled plugin appears immediately in Settings > Plugins and as `In: <label>` in an empty cell's menu. Calling `uninstall()` removes it from those creation surfaces without a restart. Existing records remain intact and use the compatibility fallback until the plugin is installed again.

## Contract rules

1. Use a globally stable, package-qualified `type`; never reuse another plugin's key.
2. Keep `cell.project` pure and fast because it runs while virtualized cells render.
3. Lazy-load the expanded UI through `renderer.load`.
4. Preserve unknown/plugin-owned fields through `migrate`, `serialize`, and `deserialize`.
5. Validate imported records before trusting them.
6. Return an uninstall function from the marketplace installation flow and retain it for the current app session.
7. Keep renderer and Settings-panel CSS in the plugin artifact, including responsive and state styles.
8. Use a stable lowercase Settings ID and a lazy panel loader when contributing a tab.

The template is not installed by default. It is executable test material and a starting structure for future marketplace packages.

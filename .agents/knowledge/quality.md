# Quality and performance knowledge

Use with `.agents/workflows/testing.md` for QA, performance, or certification tasks.

- Default Node tests are `tests/unit/**/*.test.mjs`; nested suites (`compatibility`, `platform`, `sites`, `e2e`, `visual`, `performance`) are explicit.
- Browser interaction/visual behavior uses Playwright configurations under `config/playwright/`.
- Performance runners and benchmarks live under `tests/performance/`; retained result JSON lives under `evidence/performance/`.
- Preserve sparse/virtualized sheet behavior, bounded mounted cells, input latency, and bundle budgets.
- Do not replace measured baselines or certification evidence without recording environment, command, commit, and comparison.
- A checked-in report is evidence from its recorded run, not a timeless certification.

Current result JSON under `evidence/performance/` and visual assets under `images/` are retained evidence. Read only the artifact relevant to the metric being investigated.
